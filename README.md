# TG_catalogue
This is the telegramm bot
This is the first project on Python
I used the aiogram and sqlite3 libraries

The bot knows how to interact with the client and the administrator.
Administrator:
- Edits the product catalogue
- receives reports in excel
- Edits customer orders
Customer:
- browses the catalogue
- places/cancels order
